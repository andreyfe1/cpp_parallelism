# C++ Parallel Examples

Here you can find examples for parallel entities in the C++ standard to see how parallelism in the C++ language evolve.

Following examples are available:

## C++11

* [std::thread](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread)
* [std::atomic](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic)
* [std::mutex](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/mutex)

## C++17

* [Parallel STL](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/execution_policy_tag)
* [Parallel STL with Boost iterators](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_82_0/libs/iterator/doc/index.html#:~:text=The%20Boost%20Iterator%20Library%20contains,includes%20several%20useful%20iterator%20adaptors)

## C++20

* [std::jthread](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/jthread)
* [Barriers](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/barrier)
* [Latches](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/latch)
* [Semaphores](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/counting_semaphore)

## C++20/23

* [Ranges & views](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges). Note: it's not parallel yet, but it's useful to share, anyway.

Hope, you will will enjoy parallel programming in C++ :)
